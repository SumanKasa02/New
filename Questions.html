<h3>What is a Relational Database?</h3>
  <p>
    A relational database is a type of database that stores data in the form of tables (called relations). 
    Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Data in different tables can be related 
    to each other through keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relational database model was introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970 and is widely used due to its simplicity, 
    flexibility, and the power of Structured Query Language (SQL) for data management and querying.
  </p>

  <h2>How is it Different from Other Database Models?</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Hierarchical Model:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hierarchical model organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.</li>
    <li>Relational model uses tables with no strict hierarchy, allowing more flexible data access.</li>
    <li>Relational databases can easily handle many-to-many relationships, while hierarchical models cannot.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. Network Model:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network model organizes data as a graph, allowing multiple parent-child relationships.</li>
    <li>Relational model simplifies this by using tables and keys to establish relationships.</li>
    <li>Navigation in network model is complex due to pointers, whereas relational model uses SQL for easy access.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>3. Object-Oriented Model:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Object-oriented model stores data as objects with properties and methods, like in OOP languages.</li>
    <li>Relational model uses simple tables with rows and columns, without directly supporting methods.</li>
    <li>Object-oriented databases are better for multimedia and complex data, while relational databases are best for structured data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Differences:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Relational uses tables; other models use trees, graphs, or objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Relational model is more flexible for ad-hoc queries.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard Language:</strong> Relational databases use SQL, a widely accepted standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Relational databases easily handle complex relationships using keys.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>What is Data Redundancy?</h2>
  <p>
    Data redundancy means storing the same piece of data in multiple places within a database or file system.
    It occurs when the same data is unnecessarily duplicated in different files or tables. For example, in 
    a traditional file processing system, a customer’s address might be stored separately in different files 
    for billing, shipping, and customer support. This leads to wasted storage space and can cause 
    inconsistencies when updates are made in one place but not in others.
  </p>

  <h2>How Does a DBMS Help in Reducing Data Redundancy?</h2>
  <p>
    A Database Management System (DBMS) helps reduce data redundancy by storing data in a centralized database 
    where data is organized into tables and shared among multiple applications. Data normalization techniques 
    are used to structure the database so that each piece of information is stored only once, and related 
    data is linked through keys. This centralized control ensures that updates made to data are reflected 
    throughout the entire database, eliminating unnecessary duplication and maintaining consistency and 
    accuracy of information.
  </p>

<h3>Who is a Database Administrator (DBA)? Write the major Responsibilities of a DBA.</h3>
  <p>
    A Database Administrator (DBA) is a person responsible for managing, maintaining, and securing a database system.
    The DBA ensures that the database is available, performs efficiently, remains secure, and is protected against
    data loss or corruption. DBAs play a crucial role in the daily operations of organizations that rely on databases
    to store and process large amounts of information.
  </p>
<p>Major Responsibilities of a DBA are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Designing the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, and constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Implementing access controls and security measures to protect data from unauthorized access or breaches.</li>

  </ul>



  <h3>Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF and 3NF with suitable examples. Explain the normalization process with examples.
you can use tables for examples </h3>
  <p>
    Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
    It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.
    The main goal of normalization is to eliminate duplicate data, ensure data dependencies make sense,
    and store data efficiently.
  </p>

  <h4>First Normal Form (1NF)</h4>
  <p>
    A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) if it contains only atomic (indivisible) values and each column
    contains values of a single type. There must be no repeating groups or arrays.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Unnormalized data:</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Student_ID</th>
      <th>Student_Name</th>
      <th>Subjects</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Math, English</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>Science, Math</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Normalized to 1NF:</strong></p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Student_ID</th>
      <th>Student_Name</th>
      <th>Subject</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Math</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>English</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>Science</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>Math</td>

  <h4>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h4>
  <p>
    A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally
    dependent on the entire primary key. This means removing partial dependencies.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong> 1NF table (with partial dependency):</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Student_ID</th>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>Student_Name</th>
      <th>Teacher</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Math</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Mr. Smith</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>English</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Ms. Johnson</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Normalized to 2NF:</strong></p>

  <h4>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h4>
  <p>
    A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are only dependent on the primary key,
    not on other non-key attributes. This means removing transitive dependencies.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong> 2NF table with transitive dependency:</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Student_ID</th>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>Teacher</th>

<h3>Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with examples.</h3>
<h2>Primary Key</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>Primary Key</strong> is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
    It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a <em>Students</em> table, <code>Student_ID</code> can be the primary key since it uniquely identifies each student.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Foreign Key</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>Foreign Key</strong> is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
    It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a <em>Enrollments</em> table, <code>Student_ID</code> can be a foreign key referring to the <code>Student_ID</code> primary key in the <em>Students</em> table.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Candidate Key</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>Candidate Key</strong> is a column, or a set of columns, that can uniquely identify any row in the table.
    There can be multiple candidate keys in a table, and one of them is chosen as the primary key.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a <em>Employees</em> table, both <code>Employee_ID</code> and <code>Social_Security_Number</code> could be candidate keys because each uniquely identifies an employee.</li>
    <li>One of these candidate keys, say <code>Employee_ID</code>, is chosen as the primary key.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with examples.</h3>
<h4>Primary Key</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>Primary Key</strong> uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must be unique and cannot be NULL.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example: Students Table</strong></p>
  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Student_ID (Primary Key)</th>
        <th>Student_Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>101</td><td>Alice</td><td>20</td></tr>
      <tr><td>102</td><td>Bob</td><td>21</td></tr>
      <tr><td>103</td><td>Charlie</td><td>19</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Foreign Key</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>Foreign Key</strong> is a column that creates a link between two tables by referring to the Primary Key of another table.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example: Enrollments Table</strong></p>
  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Enrollment_ID</th>
        <th>Student_ID (Foreign Key)</th>
        <th>Course</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>101</td><td>Math</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>102</td><td>English</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>103</td><td>Science</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Candidate Key</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>Candidate Key</strong> is any column or set of columns that can uniquely identify rows in a table.
    One candidate key is selected as the Primary Key.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example: Employees Table</strong></p>
  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Employee_ID (Candidate Key)</th>
        <th>Social_Security_Number (Candidate Key)</th>
        <th>Employee_Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>201</td><td>123-45-6789</td><td>David</td></tr>
      <tr><td>202</td><td>987-65-4321</td><td>Eve</td></tr>
      <tr><td>203</td><td>456-78-9012</td><td>Frank</td></tr>

<h3>What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions.</h3>
  <p>
    SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
    It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data stored in database tables.
    SQL is widely used because of its simplicity and power in handling large volumes of data efficiently.
    It is the foundation for interacting with most relational database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
  </p>

  <h2>The components of SQL are: </h2>

  <h3>1. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h3>
  <p>
    DDL commands define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. Common DDL commands include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CREATE:</strong> To create new database objects like tables or databases.</li>
    <li><strong>ALTER:</strong> To modify existing database structures.</li>
    <li><strong>DROP:</strong> To delete tables or other database objects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h3>
  <p>
    DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database. These commands allow users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SELECT:</strong> Retrieve data from one or more tables.</li>
    <li><strong>INSERT:</strong> Add new records into a table.</li>
    <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Modify existing data within a table.</li>
    <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Remove records from a table.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Data Control Language (DCL)</h3>
  <p>
    DCL commands manage permissions and access control to the database. They regulate who can do what with the data. Key commands are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GRANT:</strong> Give users permission to perform certain tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>REVOKE:</strong> Remove previously granted permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)</h3>
  <p>
    TCL commands manage transactions to ensure data integrity. Transactions are sequences of operations treated as a single unit. Important TCL commands include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>COMMIT:</strong> Save all changes made in the current transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>ROLLBACK:</strong> Undo changes made in the current transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>SAVEPOINT:</strong> Set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common SQL Functions</h2>

  <h3>Aggregate Functions</h3>
  <p>These perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>COUNT():</strong> Counts the number of rows.</li>
    <li><strong>SUM():</strong> Adds up values in a column.</li>
    <li><strong>AVG():</strong> Calculates the average of numeric values.</li>
    <li><strong>MAX():</strong> Finds the highest value.</li>
    <li><strong>MIN():</strong> Finds the lowest value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>String Functions</h3>
  <p>These manipulate text data. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CONCAT():</strong> Concatenates (joins) two or more strings.</li>
    <li><strong>UPPER() / LOWER():</strong> Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.</li>
    <li><strong>SUBSTRING():</strong> Extracts a part of a string.</li>
  </ul>
